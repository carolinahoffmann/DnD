    "You step into the corridor.": "The air is still, thick with the scent of dust and something faintly sweet — old wood, maybe. Along the walls, portraits stare back at you. Men and women from another time, their eyes almost alive in the flickering light. You slow your pace. Maybe this place isn’t lost after all... One picture catches your attention — a man with sharp features, a woman beside him. You feel something twist in your chest. Do I know this man? Is that... his mother? Before you can finish the thought, a faint squeak echoes from upstairs. A floorboard? Or... something else? The silence that follows feels heavier. Roll the dice.",
